\section {Reference Frame Convention}
The {\bf Mineos} code uses the following convention for the Cartesian reference frame defining the standard sensor orientation:
\begin{itemize}
\item the $x$ axis points East
\item the $y$ axis points North
\item the $z$ axis points up
\end{itemize}
Note that this convention is the same as for {\bf SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE} code, and it is
different from the Harvard Centroid-Moment Tensor 
(CMT) convention. The Harvard CMT convention is
\begin{itemize}
\item the $x$ axis points South
\item the $y$ axis points East
\item the $z$ axis points up
\end{itemize}
