	* [r6060] Added Guy Masters's SIO227B class notes as additional
	  documentation for the Mineos package. This includes 'cig.ppt',
	  which is the PowerPoint presentation that Guy Masters gave on
	  Wednesday, November 1st, 2006 at the Earthscope Imaging
	  Science/CIG Seismology Joint Workshop on Computational
	  Seismology. This check-in is simply a snapshot of this web page:
	  http://mahi.ucsd.edu/Guy/sio227b/

	* [r6059] Moved syndat -> mineos, because the package is, as it
	  turns out, called MINEOS. (This is consistent with Guy's slides
	  from his talk at the Earthscope Imaging Science/CIG Seismology
	  Joint Workshop on Computational Seismology.)

	* [r4040] Use F77_FUNC in 'leolib' files.

2006-07-20 03:05  leif

	* [r4038] Added GNU build system, and boilerplate GNU info files.
	  Got all the programs to build on my Linux system. I had to hunt
	  down xvertext-5.0 on the web to replace the missing "rotated.h".
	  Also, I whipped-up a replacement for the missing "leolib.col"
	  include file, based upon an examination of the surrounding
	  source. For now, I hard-coded the X11 link flags for 'curse'
	  (maybe there's a good Autoconf macro for this out there... or
	  not).

	* [r4037] Initial import of Guy Master's eigcon/green/syndat
	  synthetic seismogram programs.
